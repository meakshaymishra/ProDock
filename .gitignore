# Generally, ignore specific resource files ONLY if they are sensitive or huge temp data
# Example: MyBigDataFile.dat

# If you add a file like secrets.plist or .env, add it here:
# secrets.plist
# .env

# Sometimes intermediate entitlements are generated. Usually the source .entitlements is committed.
